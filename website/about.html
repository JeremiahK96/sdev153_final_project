		<h1 id="content-start">About Me</h1>
		<p>My programming journey has been an unusual one; however, it has been a lot of fun and caused me to grow into the software developer that I am today.</p>
		<h2>The Early Days</h2>
		<p>When I was 9, I had a computer-tutor toy from 1988 called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTech_PreComputer_1000">VTech Pre-Computer 1000</a>. Among its few features was a simplified BASIC interpreter. You had 2KB of ROM to work with, and you couldn't save your programs, but instead had to type them by hand every time. There was a user manual, which I read, but I mostly just learned by doing. A surprisingly large variety of programs could be written within this tiny sandbox environment! I taught myself the basics of simple data types like strings and arrays, and came up with the Fisher-Yates shuffle on my own.</p>
		<p>I first gained access to the Internet in my teens, and I briefly dabbled with Python, HTML, and C++. However, it was always just a hobby. I wanted to pursue 3D computer graphics art, and I never really got serious about programming until my early 20's.</p>
		<h2>Discovering AtariAge</h2>
		<p>At some point, I discovered the AtariAge website, specifically the <a href="https://forums.atariage.com/forum/50-atari-2600-programming/">Atari 2600 Programming Forum</a>. This piqued my interest because I had played several Atari 2600 games as a kid. I decided to try writing a program for the Atari, and learned that the programs must be coded in 6502 Assembly Language. I spent a couple days learning 6502 Assembly from an interactive website called <a href="http://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/">Easy 6502</a>, and began writing simple programs for the Atari, testing them out in the Stella emulator.</p>
		<p>The Atari 2600 is a difficult beast to tame, and has a lot of quirks. There are 128 bytes of RAM, and there is no video buffer. All you have to work with is a few dozen registers which can be written to which affect the picture and sound. This is both a curse and a blessing, because although even the simplest display kernels can be quite complicated to write, you have a great deal of control over the hardware. This allows you to pull off some fancy tricks, some of which were not even intended by the hardware designers.</p>
		<h2>Writing a Complete Game for the Atari 2600</h2>
		<p>I spent a few years tinkering with the Atari in my spare time, and eventually felt competent enough to write a complete game. One day when I checked the forums, I saw Jeff Haber had posted a new display kernel for an 8x8 grid of individually colored tiles. I contacted him, and we agreed to work together on writing a clone of Bejeweled using this kernel.</p>
		<p>From June through December of 2020, we wrote the entire game, fitting it into a 2KB ROM. The final bugfixes were finished on <a href="https://forums.atariage.com/topic/308157-blocks-completed-formerly-bblocks/?do=findComment&comment=4726370">January 15, 2021</a>, and the game was later published in cartridge form by AtariAge under the name <a href="https://atariage.com/store/index.php?l=product_detail&p=1270">BLOCKS</a>.</p>
		<h2>Planned Personal Projects</h2>
		<p>I have been working on a couple projects since BLOCKS. One project I have been planning for some time is a multi-threaded CD-ripping utility written in C which would allow simultaneous rips using multiple optical drives, all with automatic disc lookups for the metadata. Another project I have been working on recently is a static website generator, which will be written in UNIX shell script as a prototype, but potentially in C or C++ later to maximize the speed of website generation.</p>
