		<p>Hello! I am Jeremiah Knol, and this is my blog.</p>
		<p>I write about many topics, but mostly programming. I have been programming as a hobby since I was nine, and have worked on many personal projects. Recently I have begun a more serious programming journey, and started this blog to document and share it with the world.</p>
