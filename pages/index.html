			<h2>Welcome to My Blog!</h2>
			<p>I am Jeremiah Knol, and I write about many topics, but mostly programming. I have been programming as a hobby since I was nine, and have worked on many personal projects. Recently I have begun a more serious programming journey, and started this blog to document it, sharing it with the world.</p>
